# Spring_Hibernate
This is a simple example to learn how to run a project with spring and Hibernate. it implement the increase, update, get, delete features.
Run the test code in source of java, and check the log window in IDEA, which will show the result.

Also I add some comment on the configration files which can help us to understand code better.
